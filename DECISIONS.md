# Decisions log — architecture-most-correct worktree

## Phase 0 baseline (test suite at HEAD = e7eec65 "tension point")

```
Test Suites: 3 failed, 32 passed, 35 total
Tests:       2 failed, 2626 passed, 2628 total
```

Pre-existing failures (not caused by this refactor):
- `src/tests/analysis-observe-value.test.ts` — TS2339: `observeWrite` not on `TypeAnalysisPass`/`ConstAnalysisPass` (the "tension point" commit removed the method but left tests).
- `src/tests/worklist-observations.test.ts` — `typeAfter` does not differ from `typeBefore` after `observeWrite`.
- `src/tests/observation-sink-sync.test.ts` — sync-tripwire never throws.

These tests exercise the dissolved-by-design observation pathway. They will be **deleted** in Phase 2/3 when their dissolved primitives are removed, not patched.

Green-checkpoint definition for this run: 32/35 suites passing, 2626 tests passing. Any new commit must keep that floor or improve on it (expected: improve, as dissolved tests get deleted).
